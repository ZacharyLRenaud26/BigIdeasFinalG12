    "When we sought to find the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh, we decided to focus on safety as the determining factor. We used three datasets to help find the safest neighborhood and after our research, we found that Mt. Lebanon was the safest. The datasets we used to find this were COVID vaccinations, arrest records, and food inspection violations. We feel that these datasets help prove that Mt. Lebanon is not only the safest, but the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh.\n",
